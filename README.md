Collection of assignments done at university for a Machine Vision Course

Code written in C++, using OpenCV.

- Lab 1: Intro to OpenCV (Not included)
- Lab 2: Classifying objects rolling on a conveyor belt video. Focuses on using the OpenCV findContours functions.
- Lab 3: Implement a [Circle RANSAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sample_consensus) extraction method for identifying circles in given images.
- Lab 4: Facial recognition using PCA, 'Eigenfaces', and nearest-neighbour algorithms.
- Lab 5: Feature tracking and Optical flow with [SURF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speeded_up_robust_features) and [SIFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform) features to determine the motion of objects in a video.
- Take-home Exam: [Stereo reconstruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_reconstruction#Binocular_stereo_vision) using the [Middlebury dataset](http://vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/data/) to turn a pair of stereo images into a 3D point set.
